Pedals

using Arduino Uno R3 as throttle and brake pedals for racing games etc
arduino writes value of analog pin to serial and a python program reads it continuously, sending it to vJoy's simulated joystick controller

Requirements:
vJoy
python (i think it needs to be 32-bit to work with pyvjoy, I'm using 2.7)
pyserial
pyvjoy (pip install pyvjoy)

I also recommend a program like Pointy's Joystick Test to make sure it works

**YOU NEED TO COPY vJoyInterface.dll from the x86 folder of the vjoy installation directory INTO the pyvjoy package directory, probably Lib\site-packages\pyvjoy\utils\x86 )
